## Pretzel

A simple, pluggable site generation tool for .NET developers and Windows users (with Mono support planned I think)

Pretzel follows the same conventions as  [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and should be compatible with basic Jekyll websites. If you are not familiar with Jekyll, have a read at [http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/)

### Usage

The principal commands are the following but more informations are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/Code52/pretzel/wiki)

**Create** is used to create the folder structure for a new site.

    pretzel create
    
If the site should be at a specific folder, this can be specified as a parameter:

    pretzel create C:\path\to\folder

**Bake** is used to generate a site based on the contents of a folder.

To scan the current directory for a website and detect the content to process, run:

    pretzel bake 

To scan a specific folder and parse the contents, run:

    pretzel bake C:\path\to\folder

To explicitly specify the input - we should support inferring the input based on the files found anyway - run:

    pretzel bake --engine liquid
    

**Taste** is for testing a site locally - make a change, and pretzel should handle regenerating the page when a file changes.

To test a site locally, run:

	pretzel taste 

To specify the port to serve the site from (default will be 4000), run:

    pretzel taste --port 5000

To stop the site, press q.

### Getting started

**Getting started with Git and GitHub**

 * [Setting up Git for Windows and connecting to GitHub](http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/)
 * [Forking a GitHub repository](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)
 * [The simple guide to GIT guide](http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/)

Once you're familiar with Git and GitHub, clone the repository and run the ```.\build.cmd``` script to compile the code and run all the unit tests. You can use this script to test your changes quickly.

### Discussing ideas 

* [Trello Board](https://trello.com/board/pretzel/4f25ffb3dbbed1ab5a4f0f5a) - add ideas, or claim an idea and start working on it!
* [JabbR Chatroom](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/code52) - discuss things in real-time with people all over the world!
